# ngzkHandshakeTable
 Display handshake/meet-and-greet sales of each Nogizaka46 CD in a reasonably good-looking table.

# TODO
- Add a table reading guide
- Replace member json data by NGZK official one
- Better information (regarding timing of 完売) when comparing with other records
- New table (or graph): Sales progression, and accumulated sales numebr
- Companion project: write a forTUNE music scrapper to automate update of DB
